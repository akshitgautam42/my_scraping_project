# DentalStall Scraper

## Overview
This project is designed to automate the information scraping process from [DentalStall's shop page](https://dentalstall.com/shop/). It fetches product data across multiple pages, stores the data locally in JSON format, and can easily be adapted for other storage solutions. It also includes functionality for image download and API request authentication.

## Configuration
Before running the scraper, set up the environment variables for better security and flexibility:

- `BASE_URL`: The base URL of the website to scrape.
- `API_KEY`: A static API key for simple authentication.

Place these variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following main libraries:
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- HTTPX
- BeautifulSoup
- requests

Install dependencies using Poetry:
```bash
poetry install
```

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The FastAPI application entry point.
- `scraper_service.py`: Contains the logic for fetching and parsing web pages.
- `models.py`: Defines Pydantic models for data validation.
- `storage/`: Contains modules for data handling:
  - `json_storage.py`: Handles storing data in JSON format.
  - `image_storage.py`: Manages downloading and storing images.
- `test/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
- `.env`: (Not included in repository) Should contain environment variables.

## Running the Application
Start the server with:
```bash
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Using the API
Send a POST request to `/scrape/` with the following JSON body:
```json
{
  "pages": 5
}
```
Include the API key in the headers:
```json
{
  "access_token": "your_api_key_here"
}
```

## Testing
Run tests using:
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Ensure your tests cover API routes, integration between components, and unit tests for individual functions.

## Security
The API uses a simple API key mechanism for basic security. Make sure to replace this with a more robust authentication method for production environments.
